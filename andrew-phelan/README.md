# Code 301 Lab 03 jQuery and Events

**Andrew Bloom and Robert Reed**
**Version 1.0.2**

## Overview
Our goal with this project was to build a mobile-first site, using jQuery to dynamically render blog posts sorted by most recent publication date. Additional functionality includes being able to sort the articles by author and category from drop down lists. Also, only a preview of each article is shown, and a read more button, when pressed, reveals the entire article.

## Getting Started
To build this app on your own machine, clone this repo and launch the html page in your browser.

## Architecture
We are using a SMACSS organization of our CSS. We are using jQuery to dynamically render and manipulate DOM elements.

## Credits and Collaborations
Created by Andrew Bloom and Rob Reed, based off of source code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. We used the clearfix CSS convention from CSS Tricks: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/, the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css and the jQuery v3.2.1 library. CSS code originates from Nicholas Carignan and Rob Reed.
